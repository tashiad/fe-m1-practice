## Ch 13-15: Boxes and Layout

**1. Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.**  
* border: separates the edge of one box from another
* margin: sits outside the edge of the border, creates a gap between the borders of 2 adjacent boxes
* padding: space between the border of a box and any content contained within it  

**2. For a CSS rule `padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px`, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?**  
top = 1px, right = 2px, bottom = 5px, left = 10px   

**3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.**  
Block elements always appear on a new line. Inline elements sit within a block level.   

**4. What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?**  
Positions an element in relation to the browser window as opposed to the containing element. They don't move when the user scrolls up or down the page. This can cause boxes to overlap. The z-index allows you to control which box appears on top.  

**5. What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?**  
Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user changes the size of their browser window. Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the user changes the size of their browser window.
