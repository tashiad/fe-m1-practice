    <h2>Learn more about my parents' dog</h2>
    <p><strong>This is Timber.</strong> He is a golden retreiver and is about 1.5 years old. His nickname is Tim. My parents got him a little over a year ago. Since I don't have a dog of my own, I love visiting my parents back in Oregon so that I can play with their puppy!</p>
    <p>Timber is very friendly and loving. When you start petting him, he "melts" to the floor and rolls on his back for a belly rub almost every time. He is a good adventure pup and we take him on hikes with us often. He is also very mellow for a puppy, which has been nice for my parents, especially when training him.</p>
