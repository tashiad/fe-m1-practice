Whether it's within the `<p>` tag (or other block element) or not.  

**3. What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?**  
Jpg is better for photos with many different colors, while pngs are better for images with only a couple of colors like logos (or transparency).  

## Ch 16: Images CSS

**1. What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?**  
Allows you to have more consistency for images across your site.  

**2. What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?**
