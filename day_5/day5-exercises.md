## Ch 2: Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays

**1. How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?**  
Variable keyword (var, let, or const) + variable name ;  
The equals sign ("assignment operator") really means you're assigning a value to the variable.

**2. There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.**  
* Numbers: any number, including integers, decimals, negatives
* Strings: letters and other characters, any kind of text
* Booleans: true or false    

**3. What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?**  
  1. Name must begin with a letter, $, or _. NOT a number.
  2. Name can contain letters, numbers, $, or _. NO dashes or periods.
  3. Cannot use keywords or reserved words (break , case , catch , continue , debugger , default , delete , do , else , finally , for , function , if , in , instanceof , new , return , switch , this , throw , try , typeof , var , void , while , and with).
  4. Variables are case sensitive, so don't create two variables that have the same name using different cases.
  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information the variable stores.
  6. Use camelCase.

**4. How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?**  
Arrays are especially useful when you don't know how many items a list will contain.  
To access a value in an array, you can use `array name[index number]`.  
To change a value in an array, you can assign it a new value `array name[index number] = 'new value';`.   

**5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**  
Each individual instruction step is a statement (ends with a ;). An expression evaluates into a single value.  

**6. What are three types of operators and how are they used?**  
Addition (adds one value to another), subtraction (subtracts one value from another), increment (adds one to the current number).
